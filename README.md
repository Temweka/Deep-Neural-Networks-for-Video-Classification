# Deep Neural Networks for Video Classification

This repository can be used to train deep neural networks for video classification. It also contains several Jupyter notebooks to transform data into the format required and to analyze model outputs.

## Setup
This code is intended to be run on a machine with a GPU. It could be run locally or using a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. 

## Training a Model
A single model can be trained using the `train_single_model.ipynb` notebook. 

## Helper Notebooks
There are several helper notebooks included in the `/notebooks/` directory.

### > `helper_extract_frames.ipynb`
This notebook can be used to 

### > `helper_convert_timestamps_file_to_labels.ipynb`
This notebook can be used to 

### > `helper_check_frames_against_labels.ipynb`
This notebook can be used to 

### > `helper_add_train_valid_test_splits_to_labels.ipynb`
This notebook can be used to 

### > `helper_explore_dataset.ipynb`
This notebook can be used to
